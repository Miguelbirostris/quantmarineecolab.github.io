Amanda (she/her/hers) is a junior at the University of New Hampshire. She is currently working on a major in Marine, Estuarine, and Freshwater Biology with a Math? minor. Amanda is excited to continue developing her mathematical and statistical skills, and using R along with them! She is interested in using these skills for mathematical modeling of fish populations that may better inform and direct management efforts. 

With a longstanding background in agriculture working on a farm during a gap year and as the President of her High Schoolâ€™s Future Farmers of America Chapter, Amanda is passionate about sustainable agriculture and how sustainability can apply to our ocean practices as well. Especially how efforts to preserve ocean life and bolster human industry can be made mutually beneficial.

Outside of school she likes to swim, sail, ice skate, and ride horses as a member of the UNH Equestrian Team.
