Jannine Chamorro (she/her) is a marine ecophysiologist broadly interested in assessing how organisms cope with environmental stressors across life history stages and at varying levels of biological organization. She is specifically interested in studying acclimation mechanisms of ecologically and economically important species that inhabit highly dynamic environments.

Prior to joining the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab, Jannine earned her doctoral degree from the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB), under the advisement of Dr. Gretchen Hofmann. Here, she used a combination of laboratory and field experiments to investigate mechanisms of thermal acclimation that function within and across generations in the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and the California mussel (Mytilus californianus).

One of Jannineâ€™s favorite aspects of being a researcher is mentoring undergraduate students. She enjoys introducing students to scientific research and helping them discover their passions and career paths in science. During her time at UCSB, she worked with the Field-based Undergraduate Engagement through Research, Teaching, and Education (FUERTE) program helping students prepare for careers in environmental science and conservation.
