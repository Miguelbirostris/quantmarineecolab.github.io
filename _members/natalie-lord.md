Natalie Lord (she/her/hers) is a Natural Resources and Environmental Studies PhD student. As a marine social scientist, Natalie is interested in the human dimensions of marine resource management in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Her research aims to foster a diverse and equitable seafood sector in New England through interdisciplinary research approaches and stakeholder engagement. Her dissertation research focuses on demographic data collection for the seafood sector, seafood access, and community engagement and gender dynamics in Madagascar marine protected areas. The complex social-ecological challenges of the seafood system drive Natalie’s applied research for policy intervention and she is excited to continue her graduate studies in QMEL.

In 2022, Natalie completed an MS degree in Natural Resource Management at UNH where she investigated gender equity for the region’s oyster aquaculture industry. Natalie was a 2023 Knauss Marine Policy Fellow in the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program where she coordinated the Coastal Acidification Networks and conducted a national stakeholder needs assessment. 

Outside of academia, Natalie loves to spend time in the great outdoors skiing, surfing, and spending time with family and friends along the coast of Maine.
